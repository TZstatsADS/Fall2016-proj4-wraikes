Three metrics were gathered from each of the 15 music features, creating 45 covariates.

* Mean
* Standard Deviation
* Length

### An Example

Sample Coefficients for Word "hallelujah":

Coefficient | Avg_1 | Hallelujah_1 | Avg_2 | Hallelujah_2
-------|------|------|------|------
Bars_Confidence_Mean | -7.39 | -33.47   | -1.88   | -48.24   
Bars_Start_Mean | -0.52  | -1.78  | -0.34   | 1.37
Beats_Confidence_Mean |  1.03   |  -5.24   |    5.44  |  -25.71
Beats_Confidence_SD | 1.84| -30.68  |3.16 | -13.4
Sections_Confidence_SD |   4.15 | 27.93   | 3.37   |  66.32
Segments_Start_SD  |  -0.42 | 0.79   |  -0.61    |  2.65
Bars_Start_Length |  -0.04   |  -0.1   |  -0.03    |  -0.02
Sections_Start_Length  |   0.78  |  2.14    |  1.6     | 0.66
Tatums_Start_Lenngth  |    -0.02    |  0.0      |  -0.04     |  0.0 



### Predicted Words

The predicted words are based on the expected value from the associated model.

E[X] = 0 * P(X = 0) + 1 * P(X = 1) + 2 * P(X = 2) ...

Expected number of times "Hallelujah" mentioned in song 157 is 0.12.

0.12 = 0 x (0.94) + 1 x (0.00) + 2 x (0.06)

Song # | E(X)
-------|------
155 | 0.0
156 | 0.0
157 | 0.12
158 | 0.0


The rank ordering is based on this summation of all expected values, for the given songs.
