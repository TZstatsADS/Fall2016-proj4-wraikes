# Million Song Data - Project 4


### Multinomial Regression

- Varying amount of words per song.

![formula](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/Fall2016-proj4-wraikes/blob/master/figs/multinomial_regression.png)
  
Three metrics were gathered from each of the 16 music features, creating 46 covariates.

* Mean
* Standard Deviation
* Length

### An Example

Coefficients for Word "hallelujah":

```{r}
coefficients_df
```

### Predicted Words

The predicted words are based on the expected value from the associated model.

E[X] = 0 * P(X = 0) + 1 * P(X = 1) + 2 * P(X = 2) ...

Expected number of time "Hallelujah" mentioned in song 157: 0.12.

0.12 = 0 x (0.94) + 1 x (0.00) + 2 x (0.06)

Song # | E(X)
155 | 0.0
156 | 0.0
157 | 0.12
158 | 0.0


The rank ordering is based on this summation of all expected values, for the given songs.

### Next Steps

5-fold Cross-Validation
